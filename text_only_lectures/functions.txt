/*

functions defined by fn, snake case convention

doesn't care about function placement, which is ok, because it's compiled

PROGRAM_START 

fn main() {
    println!("Hello world");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Fuck this shit!");
}

PROGRAM_END

function params:
 * must be type annotated. 
 

fn main()
{
    let x = ( let y = 6 );
}

won't compile ..  

fn main()
{
   let x = 5;
   let y = { 
     let x = 3;
     x + 1
   }

expressions don't include ending semicolon ( which means no return statement,
just the expression without semicolon )

return type specified with after arguments, like this

fn five() -> i32 {
    5 
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();
    println!("The value of x is {}", x);
}
